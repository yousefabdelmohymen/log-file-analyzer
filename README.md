   * 🏆 Most active users by method (GET/POST)
   * 📈 Request trends
   * 🚨 Patterns in failure requests

8. 🛠️ **Suggestions for Improvement**:

   * 💬 Recommendations based on the analysis findings

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yousefabdelmohymen/log-analyzer.git
   cd log-analyzer
   ```

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x log_analyzer.sh
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script with a log file as an argument:

```bash
./log_analyzer.sh /path/to/your/logfile.log
```

### 📌 Example

```bash
./log_analyzer.sh access.log
```

## 📑 Expected Log Format

The script expects log files in the **Common Log Format (CLF)** or **Extended Log Format (ELF)** similar to:

```
192.168.1.1 - - [10/Oct/2023:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 2326
```

📌 *If your log format differs, you may need to adjust the field indices in the script.*

## 📤 Sample Output

The script generates a comprehensive report that includes:

```
===================== Log Analysis Report =====================
1. Request Counts:
   - Total Requests: 12345
   - GET Requests: 9876
   - POST Requests: 2469
...
```

## ✅ Requirements
